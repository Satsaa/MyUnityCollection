# MyUnityCollection  
A collection of things related to Unity (c# scripts, shaders, etc.)  

Alot of stuff from other (MIT or similarly licensed) sources + some modifications :)  
Very unstable. Everything changes all the time.  

I will start marking some of the APIs finalized or in other words breaking changes will not be introduced for my sake and your's. Also I must finalize the fodler structure for that which is currently based on namespace structure, but for less clutter I will include some ways to folderize static classes and categories.
